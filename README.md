# Video-Game-Trend-Analysis

The recent COVID-19 pandemic restricted outdoor activities and inspired millions to try digital entertainments. In the past decades, the game industry has grown to have enormous influence on people's digital life, and became even more popular due to the widespread of internet and the progression of technology. Most people living in the modern age own one or more electronic devices that allow them to not only work with, but also play games on. At this point, choosing what game to play is just as common as choosing a movie to watch, or a music to listen. People not only consult with family members and friends, but also go to different websites and look for reviews. Metacritics, in particular, is a website that aggregates reviews from world's most renowned critics regarding video games. Metacritics provides both metascore, a weighted rating score of only the critics' reviews, and a userscore. The fact that these two scores are sometimes controversial against each other inflicted my initial interests. My project mianly has three objectives:

1. Between metascore and userscore, which more accurately reflects a game's quality?
2. What are some meaningful insights of the popularity trend?
3. Is it possible to predict a game's sales based on the scores?

(I am only focusing on games avaliable on the PC platform of all time.)
